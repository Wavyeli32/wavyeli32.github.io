title: My goals
---

I made a big progress in my goals since the beginning of this internship. My goal was to learn a lot more about open source software and get better using HTML. This catalyst program has given me the chance to better my skills. In order to continue towards my goals I have to actively participate during our lecture time and continue to do the take home assignments. Emily and Silas can continue to teach us new things and answer questions, so I will be able to achieve my goals.
