title: Step Into My World and Explore My Blog
---

I am currently an intern at the University of Santa Cruz, participating in the Catalyst program for computer science students. In this role, I am actively contributing to numerous open source projects on GitHub, showcasing my strong collaborative skills and proficiency in various programming languages and frameworks. As a graduate student at Norfolk State University, I pursue my studies with great enthusiasm and dedication. Originally from Washington, D.C., I bring the vibrant energy and rich cultural heritage of the capital city to my academic and personal endeavors.

In addition to my academic commitments, I have a deep passion for music and love to play the piano. This creative outlet not only provides me with a sense of joy and relaxation but also enhances my discipline and focus in my academic pursuits. My involvement in community service is also significant. As a member of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., I organize and participate in community service projects, mentor local youth to promote academic excellence, and engage in fundraising events for scholarships and community programs.

At Norfolk State University, I serve as the Choir Director for the Campus Ministry, where I direct and lead the choir, organize and conduct rehearsals, and plan and execute performances for worship services and special events. My volunteer activities include assisting with planning and coordinating campus ministry events, supporting outreach programs to engage students in spiritual growth and community service, and participating in food drives, clothing donations, and other charitable activities.

Additionally, I am involved in various volunteer opportunities through the campus ministry, engage in local community clean-up projects, and support initiatives aimed at helping underserved populations in the Norfolk area. My goal is to positively influence the local community through dedicated service and leadership, fostering a sense of unity and purpose among peers and community members while developing skills and experiences that contribute to personal growth and community betterment.
