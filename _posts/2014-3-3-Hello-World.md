title: Step Into My World and Explore My Blog

Gretings My name is Elijah Everett I am currently an intern at the University of Santa Cruz, participating in the Catalyst program for computer science students. In this role, I am actively contributing to numerous open source projects on GitHub, showcasing my strong collaborative skills and proficiency in various programming languages and frameworks. As a graduate student at Norfolk State University, I pursue my studies with great enthusiasm and dedication. Originally from Washington, D.C., I bring the vibrant energy and rich cultural heritage of the capital city to my academic and personal endeavors. I had little knowlegdge of open source coming into this program.

The strongest skill I can bring to the table is my knowledge using GitHub. I have used Github in a few class during my undergraduate year at Norfolk State University. During this summer I want to work more on communication and team work.
