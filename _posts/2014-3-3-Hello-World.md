Gretings My name is Elijah Everett I am currently an intern at the University of Santa Cruz, participating in the Catalyst program for computer science students. In this role, I am actively contributing to numerous open source projects on GitHub, showcasing my strong collaborative skills and proficiency in various programming languages and frameworks. As a graduate student at Norfolk State University, I pursue my studies with great enthusiasm and dedication. Originally from Washington, D.C., I bring the vibrant energy and rich cultural heritage of the capital city to my academic and personal endeavors. I had little knowlegdge of open source coming into this program.

The strongest skill I can bring to the table is my knowledge using GitHub. I have used Github in a few class during my undergraduate year at Norfolk State University. During this summer I want to work more on communication and team work.

One significant challenge I want to impact with technology is bridging the digital divide in education. This divide limits educational opportunities for students in underprivileged communities. By developing affordable technology solutions, creating user-friendly educational platforms, and providing training for teachers and students, I aim to ensure equal access to digital resources and high-quality education. Collaborating with governments, non-profits, and private sector partners is also crucial to supporting initiatives that reduce the digital divide. My goal is to help every student, regardless of socio-economic background, achieve their full potential through access to quality education and technology.

When Iâ€™m successful, the first person I want to tell about it is my mother. She has always been my biggest supporter and inspiration, constantly encouraging me to pursue my dreams and work hard. Her belief in my abilities and her unwavering support have been instrumental in my journey, and sharing my success with her would mean the world to me.
