One significant challenge I want to impact with technology is bridging the digital divide in education. This divide limits educational opportunities for students in underprivileged communities. By developing affordable technology solutions, creating user-friendly educational platforms, and providing training for teachers and students, I aim to ensure equal access to digital resources and high-quality education. Collaborating with governments, non-profits, and private sector partners is also crucial to supporting initiatives that reduce the digital divide. My goal is to help every student, regardless of socio-economic background, achieve their full potential through access to quality education and technology.

When Iâ€™m successful, the first person I want to tell about it is my mother. She has always been my biggest supporter and inspiration, constantly encouraging me to pursue my dreams and work hard. Her belief in my abilities and her unwavering support have been instrumental in my journey, and sharing my success with her would mean the world to me.
