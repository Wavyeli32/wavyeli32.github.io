I have picked the path to work with labs. First I had to learn more about the lab templates and sql injections. For the labs we decided to talk about prepared and parameterized statements. We prompt the user to identify the placeholder in the first parameterized statement. In the second exercise the user has to take the unsecured prepared statement and turn it into a secure one by separating the values and executing it. Documentation was very important for us to read so we can learn what to insert into the lab. We have also been in contact with david from slack which he has been a great help.

I learned more about sql injections and how to avoid attacks. Prepared and parameterized statements are the same. I learned the difference between the client side and server side. I understand why attackers can gain this information just by inserting a few characters. I learned how to implement a safe and secure sql query. I learned the overall function for sql injections.

I want to at least finish more than 1 lab. As of right now we are waiting for David to respond but he always responds quickly so I am not worried. I also want our labs to be merged into the openssf repo if our things are right.
