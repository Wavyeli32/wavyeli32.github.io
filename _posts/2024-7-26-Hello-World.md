One thing I learned was the definition of Imposter Syndrome, which is “A psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their skills, talents, or accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a ‘fraud’.” This definition really made me feel at home because as a new contributor you would worry about a lot of things. Especially if you just submitted a pull request to a new project. Sometimes I think to myself what if my contribution is not good enough or can be better. I am also thinking why do they need me if they have so many other better contributors. But overall I learned that projects like these need new contributors. All skills are required.

When Richard was on the call yesterday he talked about how programming can be like “performance art”, meaning it's like practicing how you play. The more you practice the more you get better at your programming. Well that's with anything in life. I totally agree with Richard's point of view. I remember when Richard said that he learned more while he was teaching it to his students. I guess experience is very important too. Once you get that experience you will perform better.

Richard stated “The longer I’ve been employed as a professional coder, the more I realize that I’m paid […] for my ability to figure out things that I do not know quickly.”  Yes this does align with my perception of Tech. At first I thought I would have to know everything in that field. I'm just learning that you don’t need to know everything. You will always make mistakes and not know everything. My participation in the Catalyst program influenced how you think that I don't need to know everything and I will probably learn new things everyday. So being able to learn during your job is good as well.
